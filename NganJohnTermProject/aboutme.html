            My name is John Ngan, I've been using the computer since i was 8 years old. </br>
            I am at my computer most of my days playing video games. </br>It is natural that I fall in love with the computer and it's peripherals. </br>
            I built my first computer when i first entered College. Throughout the years, </br>I have learned so much about the components of a computer such as; 
            </br>refresh rate of monitors, mousepads, and most importantly mechanical keyboards. 
          </div>
          <aside>
            <h1>My First Mechanical Keyboard</h1>
            <p>It was a Das Keyboard with brown switches, it had no letters engraved onto the key-caps</p>
          </aside>
          <div>
            The fact that I am on the computer almost all day I started to become more enthusiastic when it comes to keyboards because,</br> I am typing
            most of the time, playing video games or studying. </br>When I got my first mechanical keyboard over cheap rubber domes, it changed my life.
            </br>I cannot see myself using cheap rubber domes as a daily driver ever again.</br> Mechanical keyboards feel so much smoother and its more enjoyable to type on.
          </div>
          <h2>My Personal Custom Mechanical Keyboard</h2>
          <div>(It took me about 8hours to build, due to the lubing process and soldering.)</div>
